Our Discord server is the best place to discuss our public API, get help from our engineers and community devs,
find collaborators, and promote your projects using the API!

## How to Join our Community on Discord

1. If you do not already have a Discord account, then <a href="https://discordapp.com/register" target="_blank">make one</a>!
2. Go to <a href="https://discord.gg/smashgg" target="_blank">discord.gg/smashgg</a> to join our server
3. Once you have joined our server, go to the #flairing
   channel, type `/roleme 3rd-party-devs`, and hit Enter
   (this will give you the 3rd-party-devs role in our server)
4. Now you can read and participate in channels like
   #api-alpha-discussion, so say hello and introduce yourself.
   We can't wait to meet you!
