title: Shop Info, Goals, and Order Messages
sidebar_label: "Shop Info"

In this example, we will query for a shop, its shop levels, and order messages by the shop slug.
In this case, we've chosen the Summit of Time Compendium as the shop.

## Example

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
defaultValue="graphql"
values={[
{ label: 'Request', value: 'graphql', },
{ label: 'Response', value: 'json', },
]
}>

<TabItem value="graphql">

```graphql
query Shop ($slug: String) {
  shop (slug: $slug) {
    id
    name
    slug
    messages(query: {
        page:1
        perPage:5
    }) {
      nodes {
        total
        message
        gamertag
        name
      }
    }
    levels(query: {
        page:1
        perPage:5
    }) {
      nodes {
        name
        goalAmount
        currAmount
        description
