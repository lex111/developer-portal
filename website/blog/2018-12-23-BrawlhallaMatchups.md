Brawlhalla Matchups is an <a href="https://github.com/henryaguerra/brawlhalla-matchups-bot" target="_blank">open
source</a> Discord bot to find results for matchups between your favorite
<a href="https://www.brawlhalla.com/" target="_blank">Brawlhalla</a> players!

<!--truncate-->

## The Creator

Henry "Mother Russia" Guerra is a Brawlhalla community member who created this Discord bot as
a resource for the community to learn more about its players' histories against each other.
When I asked him if he had anything he wanted to say to the community, he
simply said he would like to thank the community for being supportive of the project.

## Add it to your Server

The <a href="https://github.com/henryaguerra/brawlhalla-matchups-bot/blob/master/README.md"
 target="_blank">readme file on the GitHub repo</a> explains how to quickly add the bot
to a Discord server you own, using Discord oAuth.

## Use it on your Server

To use the matchups bot, just type in the command with a couple of players you're interested in!
In the below example, I looked at the top 8 bracket for the Brawlhalla Autumn Championships NA,
where Isidroo 2-0'd Boomie in the losers semifinals match.

I wondered if this was a common result for their matches together, so I hopped into my Discord server
and used the Brawlhalla Matchups bot to see if they've played each other before.
I learned that they have crossed paths three times, and in one of those Boomie actually 3-0'd Isidroo.
It seems too early to draw any conclusions about their head-to-head matchup,
so we'll have to see what happens the next few times they square off!
